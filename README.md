# AutoDriveRL

Autonomous driving using Reinforcement Learning and DonkeyCar.

## Installation

1. Make sure Docker is installed on your computer.
2. Install the DonkeyGym simulator by running
    ```
    ./scripts/install_sim.sh
    ```
3. For first time setup, run:
    ```
    ./start_docker.sh dev
    ```
    After the first setup, you can omit the `dev` argument and the cached docker image will be used (much faster)
4. The project is ready to go!
